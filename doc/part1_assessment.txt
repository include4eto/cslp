At this stage you are not required to submit any source code. 
Instead, you should submit a *proposal document* that explains 
how you plan to implement:
1. Handling command line arguments;
2. Parsing and validation of input scripts;
3. Generation, scheduling, and execution of events;
4. Graph manipulation/route planning algorithms;
5. Statistics collection;
6. Experimentation support and results visualisation;
7. Code testing.
