# CSLP Proposal

## Programming Language
The language of choice is Python, mostly because input formating is easier, but
also since it is widely used in scientific projects. The latter means we already
have statistics and data-processing libraries that have been tested in a more
rigorous environment. Namely
	- scipy - data processing & statistics
	- numpy - data manipulation, but also some rudimentary probabilistic functions
	- matplotlib - for plotting data

In addition, python is faster than some more popular choices (java). It is slower
than C, though C adds too much additional overhead than needed (memory management
in particular).
